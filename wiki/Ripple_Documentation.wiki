#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =


In literally 99.995% of taxi operations, after correctly reading back a taxi clearance, the pilot proceeds to the runway without incident.   However, about once every 20,000 operations something goes awry and the result is a Runway Incursion (RI).  In a typical year there are about 350 runway incursions. Incursions remain a big deal in aviation safety; they have been on the NTSB’s Most Wanted list since its inception.  In fact, the worst accident in aviation history (a collision on the runway at Tenerife airport) was the result of a runway incursion.     In about 55% of all runway incursions, the pilot correctly reads back the hold short clearance as given by the controller and then proceeds through the hold line without stopping.  This type of incursion – the Pilot Deviation - has three common causes including: a lost pilot, a distracted pilot, and a pilot who forgets or misremembers the taxiway clearance.

A lot of technology has been built to address the runway incursion problem including RAAS (Runway Awareness Advisory System), surface moving maps, ASDE-X safety logic, and Runway Status Lights.  While effective where employed, these solutions are also typically very expensive.  That expense comes with a “cost” – a loss in coverage.   As the expense of a technology increases, the General Aviation (GA) access to that technology generally decreases.  The loss of GA coverage is important because GA aircraft are involved in 75% of all runway incursions and in 82% of all Pilot Deviations.  To provide better RI prevention coverage for the GA population, we need a low-cost solution that’s not dependent on airport infrastructure.  And, in order to provide protection from all three common causes of pilot deviations, that solution needs to be able to capture the taxi clearance.     

As it turns out, GPS enabled handheld devices like the Palm, Blackberry, and iPhone may be an excellent platform for a low-cost incursion prevention system.  The devices are often already owned by the pilot and deployment of apps for these systems is relatively inexpensive.  GPS insures that the pilot is not dependent on airport infrastructure and all of these devices provide a variety of ways to input the taxi clearance. The MITRE Corporation is funding an internal R&D project to investigate the technical and procedural feasibility of using handheld devices in this manner.  

As the pilot and controller communicate with each other, the device listens for hold short instructions.  The hold short instructions the device “heard” (via speech recognition) are then presented on the display.  What does the device do?  Most of the time it does absolutely nothing.  If the algorithm predicts the aircraft will hold short of the runway it provides no reminders.  Therefore, the device does not give indiscriminate warnings and largely remains transparent to the pilot.  On the other hand, if, after being instructed to hold short, it looks like the pilot is not going to stop the device will provide a visual and aural reminder.

When the pilot opens the app, it immediately determines what airport the pilot is at.  Each runway at the airport is then is represented on the screen using one of the sliders depicted in the image below.   Runways should be presented in order of runway heading.  Where they exist, left runways should be presented prior to center runways which are presented prior to Right runways.  

Each slider has three positions: "Not Set," Hold Short, and Cleared to Cross.  The slider is initially presented in the "Not Set" position and the background of the slider grayed out to indicate no instruction for that runway has been input into the device.  Sliders were chosen to minimize the likelihood of inadvertently setting the runway status.  The red slider mimics the runway sign and runway holding position markings.  Clearance to cross or hold short for each runway may be set manually via the slider or automatically via speech recognition.  

Three Slider States

	Underneath the sliders a .pdf of the taxiway diagram for the airport is shown.

Taxi Diagram

	Directly under the map .pdf, is the taxi path information display.  It is a text display that, should the pilot choose to enter the full taxi path, provides an easily accessed visual reminder.  If the pilot elects not to enter the taxi path, hold short and cleared to cross may be summarized here.  In order to enter the taxi path, the user touches the taxi path icon which will bring up a custom keyboard, discussed shortly.  It has not been determined by this team if the taxi path should use full words (Alpha) are just the taxiway letters (A).  There may also be some symbology that pilots use when writing down these instructions that may be useful.

Menu Bar at Bottom of Display


	Pressing the Taxi Path button presents the user with a specialized keyboard  It should, as shown in the image below, include the following special keys: "hold short of", "cleared to cross", along with a set of runway keys.  In addition, as numerals and letters will both be used frequently, unlike the standard iPhone keyboard, a row of numerals will always be present across the top of the keyboard.  The information entered here is summarized in the taxi path display described earlier.

Taxi Path Keyboard

	When the user presses the “i” button on the menu bar, he or she is presented with the option to change system settings, much of which, as seen below, revolve around the reminders provided by the app.  References to "Name" refer to the device making an aural announcement of the upcoming runway name.  The runway tones similarly advise the pilot he or she is approaching a runway, but do so with a tone rather than with a voice.

App Settings


	Should the user choose to do so, he or she can collapse the runway sliders, providing an unobstructed view of the taxi diagram.  This is done by pressing the “close” or “open button, located just beneath the sliders or hold short summary information.   The expanded and collapsed states are shown in the image below.

Runway Sliders Expanded and Collapsed

	When the runway sliders are collapsed, a summary of set hold shorts is displayed as seen in the “collapsed” section of the above image.  The large hold short reminder will display only one hold short instruction at a time.  If multiple hold short instructions are entered, the user will be able to either scroll via finger swipe or by pressing the left right arrows.  If there are multiple “hold shorts” entered, the hold short reminder that is displayed is the one the system deems most relevant.  The most relevant is determined by a) intersection of the current aircraft heading with the runway and b) proximity to the runway.  If a hold short reminder/advisory is issued by the system, that hold short instruction is then displayed.  If the user changes the hold short reminder by scrolling, then from that point on the hold short instruction displayed is the one chosen by the user except in cases where a reminder/advisory is being issued.

 
Hold Short Reminder

Title Bar

	The title bar, show in the image below, displays the aircraft tail number in the top left and the identified airport in the top right.  In the middle of the title bar is a headphones icon.  Tapping the headphones icon disables speech recognition.  When speech recognition is enabled and speech from the pilot is detected, instead of the icon, the wave forms are displayed providing the user feedback that speech is being received.  Regardless of the mode (Edit or Display), the title bar is always present.

Reminders and Advisories

	Reminders provide the core functionality of the device.  These reminders have been developed to provide protection to pilots operating in both towered and non-towered environments.  For our purposes, "without clearance" is roughly equivalent to non-towered.

	The set of reminders/advisories presented to the pilot are differentiated by whether or not a hold short and/or clearance to cross has been entered into the device and are described in the table below.  When no clearance has been entered the system will, by default, provide an aural announcement to the pilot prior to entering any runway environment.  Alternatively, the pilot may set the advisory to an aural tone rather than announcement of the runway.  The pilot will NOT have the option of having no advisory in instances he is moving on the surface without any runway clearances entered.

Device Warnings by Operational Condition and Modality

	With Clearance	Without Clearance (Non-Towered)
	Visual	Auditory	Visual	Auditory
No Instruction 	x	x	Rwy Advisory	Tone ||Rwy
Hold Short 	Hold Short of Runway 	"Hold Short" 
&& Rwy	x	x
Hold Short (Lost)	Hold Short
 No Clearance for Rwy	"Hold Short: No Clearance for Rwy" && Rwy 	x	x
Cleared to Cross 	Rwy Advisory	None ||Tone ||Rwy 	x	x


	When either a cleared to cross or hold short clearance is issued, the system reverts to the "With Clearance" set of alerts.  Included in this category is "Hold Short (Lost)." Should the pilot encounter a runway for which they have been told neither to hold short nor been given a clearance to cross, the system will provide a distinct Hold Short reminder that both reminds the pilot to hold short and advises the pilot of what runway he or she is approaching.  In both the Hold Short and Lost Hold Short case, the hold short warning is only provided if it appears (as determined by an algorithm) that the pilot is not going to stop at the hold line.  A visual representation of the Hold Short warning is provided below.
