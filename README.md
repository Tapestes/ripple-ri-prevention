# Low Cost Surface Safety
Developed as part of MITRE’s innovation program, the app is designed to address three common causes of runway incursions: a lost pilot, a distracted pilot, and a pilot who forgets or misremembers the taxi clearance.

The app provides a series of sliders to the pilot - one for each runway at the airport. Each slider has three positions: not set, cleared to hold short, and cleared to cross. The pilot sets each slider to reflect the instructions they have been issued by the pilot. Sliders can be set automatically using speech recognition or manually. In addition, the pilot can optionally set a departure runway.

The application monitors the aircraft’s position and the surface.  If - and only if - it appears the aircraft is not going to hold short as instructed visual and aural reminders are issued by the app.
