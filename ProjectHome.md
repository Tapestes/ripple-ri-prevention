Developed at MITRE as part of the MITRE Sponsored Research (MSR) program, the app allows pilots to enter clearances related to runway movement (cleared to cross, hold short) and, in instances where it appears the pilot is not going to comply with the clearance, will issue and aural and verbal warning.  An overview and demonstration is provided in the embedded video.
